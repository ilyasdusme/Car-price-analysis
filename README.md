 Car Price Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing car prices, examining factors that influence prices, and building a regression model using TensorFlow for price prediction.

# About the Project

The goal of this project is to perform a detailed analysis on a car price dataset. The project includes data cleaning, data visualization, and TensorFlow-based regression modeling. The main objective is to understand the variables that affect car prices and to make predictions for new car listings.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

## Dataset Used

The dataset used in this project contains various car attributes and prices. Each row represents a car with its characteristics and price. Example features include:
- Car type
- Model year
- Engine power
- Mileage
- Fuel type
- Transmission type

## Steps and Analysis

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset was loaded, missing values were handled, and features were formatted.
2. **Data Visualization**: Visualizations were created to explore variables that influence price and to analyze correlations.
3. **Modeling with TensorFlow**: 
   - A regression model was built and trained using TensorFlow.
   - The model's performance was evaluated, and predictions for car prices were generated.

## Results and Outputs

As a result of the TensorFlow-based modeling, the project enables car price prediction based on specific attributes. Key findings are supported by visualizations.
